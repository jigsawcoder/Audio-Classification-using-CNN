# Audio-Classification-using-CNN
ABSTRACT

The following will demonstrate how to apply Deep Learning techniques to the classification of environmental sounds, specifically focusing 
on the identification of particular urban sounds. When given an audio sample in a computer readable format (such as a .wav file) of a few 
seconds duration, we want to be able to determine if it contains one of the target urban sounds with a corresponding Classification 
Accuracy score.
To do this, we are going to create a visual representation of each of the audio samples which will allow us to identify features for 
classification, using the same techniques used to classify images with high accuracy.

Keywords: Audio tagging, audio dataset, data collection
